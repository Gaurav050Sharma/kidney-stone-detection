## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
```python
# Use type hints
def predict_image(image_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Predict kidney stone presence in medical image.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to CT scan image
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing prediction results
    """
    pass

# Follow PEP 8 formatting
# Use descriptive variable names
# Add comprehensive docstrings
```

### Medical Code Requirements
- **Validation**: All medical logic must be validated
- **Accuracy**: Prioritize precision over speed
- **Safety**: Implement fail-safe mechanisms
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation of AI decisions

### Testing Requirements
```python
# Example test structure
def test_model_prediction():
    """Test model prediction accuracy."""
    # Test with known positive case
    positive_result = predictor.predict("test_stone_image.jpg")
    assert positive_result['prediction'] == 'Stone Detected'
    
    # Test with known negative case
    negative_result = predictor.predict("test_normal_image.jpg")
    assert negative_result['prediction'] == 'Normal'
```

# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## 🏥 Kidney Stone Detection System

### ✅ Setup Complete!

Your system is now ready with:
- ✅ Virtual environment created (`kidney_stone_env`)
- ✅ All dependencies installed (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Gradio, etc.)
- ✅ 4540+ CT scan images ready for training
- ✅ Models currently training in background

---

## 📋 Current Status

### 🔄 Training in Progress
The models are currently training on your dataset:
- **Training Images**: 4540 total images
- **Normal scans**: ~1000 images  
- **Stone scans**: ~1377 images
- **Training time**: ~15-30 minutes (depending on your hardware)

### 📁 File Structure
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Training Completes)

### 1. ✅ Test Models
```bash
python test_models.py
```

### 2. 🚀 Launch Web Interface
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. 🌐 Access Interface
- Open browser to: `http://localhost:7860`
- Upload CT scan images
- Get AI analysis + medical advice

## 🔧 Commands Reference

### Virtual Environment
```bash
# Activate (if not already active)
kidney_stone_env\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate
deactivate
```

### Training & Testing
```bash
# Train models (if needed again)
python train.py

# Test trained models
python test_models.py

# Launch web app
python app.py
```

### Check Training Progress
```bash
# In PowerShell, check if models are created:
ls models/
```

---

## 📊 Expected Training Output

You should see:
1. **Data Loading**: "Loading and preprocessing data..."
2. **CNN Training**: Progress bars for epochs
3. **CNN Performance**: Accuracy metrics
4. **SVM Training**: "Training SVM model..."
5. **SVM Performance**: Classification report
6. **Model Saving**: "Training completed and models saved!"

---

## 🏥 After Training - Usage

### Upload & Analyze
1. **Run**: `python app.py`
2. **Upload**: CT scan image
3. **Click**: "Analyze Image"
4. **Get**: AI prediction + medical advice

### Example Results
```
⚠️ Stone Detected
Confidence Score: 85.3%

Individual Model Scores:
• CNN Model: 87.2%
• SVM Model: 83.4%
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Training Fails:
```bash
# Check data structure
python -c "from utils import validate_data_structure; print(validate_data_structure('data/train'))"

# Restart training
python train.py
```

### If Models Don't Load:
```bash
# Check if models exist
ls models/
# Should see: kidney_stone_cnn.h5 and kidney_stone_svm.pkl
```
